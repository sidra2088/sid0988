             As part of my journey into motion design and video editing, 
        I’ve been diving into various tools and techniques, including:
        <br>
        Animating logos with smooth transitions and dynamic movement using Adobe After Effects.
        <br>
        Syncing typography with audio to create engaging lyrical videos.
        <br>
        Combining artwork from Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to build detailed, layered animation.
        <br>
        Exploring film editing with Adobe Premiere Pro for polished video projects.
        <br>
        Plunging into more advanced film editing using AVID Media Composer—often. 
        <br>
        called “the beast” for its powerful capabilities.
        <br>
        Using Procreate to bring 2D animations to life with a creative and hands-on approach.
        <br>
        These experiences have helped me develop a versatile skill set across both motion design and 
        video production.
