     I enjoy exploring different creative fields to better understand my capabilities 
     and push my boundaries. This curiosity has helped me build a diverse set of
     transferable skills, including 2D and 3D illustration, graphic design, 
     and simple animation, using a variety of digital tools and software. 
     I have a formal background in Creativity and Design, 
     having studied at various institutions to develop and refine my craft.

    Through this ongoing journey, I’ve also gained insight into the kinds of 
    environments I work best in. I thrive in calm, focused spaces where I can 
    work independently and creatively, rather than in busy or high-traffic settings. 
    My personal interests—such as gardening, painting, reading quirky and relatable fiction, 
    baking, cooking, fitness, driving, and DIY projects—continue 
    to inspire and inform my creative approach.
